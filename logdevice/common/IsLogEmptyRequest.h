/**
 * @file
 *
 * Request that runs in the client library in order to satisfy an
 * application's call to the isLogEmpty() API. The goal is to find out
 * whether a particular log is empty. Empty is defined here as, there is no
 * record past the trim point on any storage node of the cluster for the
 * given log.
 *
 * Because one storage node contains a subset of the log's records, we need to
 * talk to more than one node to find the correct answer. This class
 * broadcasts an IS_LOG_EMPTY_Message to all storage nodes. Each storage node
 * replies with either true, false or an error status. The state of the log
 * falls into one of the following situations:
 *   - At least a copyset of nodes reply false: this means that there may be
 *     records sufficiently replicated and not (partially) trimmed such that we
 *     should consider the log non empty. In this case, this class terminates
 *     the processing early.
 *   - At least an f-majority of nodes reply true or are authoritative empty:
 *     this means that there is no record in that log, on at least f nodes. the
 *     log can be considered empty. In other words, if the log was not empty,
 *     at least one of these nodes would return false, therefore the log must
 *     be empty.
 *   - At least an f-majority of nodes responded, but none of the above were
 *     fullfilled. We started a grace period and waited for more nodes to chime
 *     in, but this remained the case until either the client timeout or grace
 *     period ran out, or only nodes that are being rebuilt or in some other
 *     transient or permanent error state remain. The log will be considered
 *     non-empty in this case, and we'll finish with status PARTIAL to indicate
 *     that the result isn't completely certain.
 *   - We did not yet receive an f-majority of responses, but all remaining
 *     nodes are either in rebuilding, or in some transient or permanent error
 *     state. Finish early and consider the log non-empty: if some nodes failed
 *     to respond because they were in some permanent error state, consider
 *     this request FAILED. Otherwise, meaning all nodes that didn't respond
 *     had some transient error or was being rebuilt, consider this a PARTIAL
 *     result.
 *   - Some nodes reply with error or didn't reply at all until the client
 *     timeout expired, such that we do not have an f-majority of nodes that
 *     chimed in on the state of the log: this means that there may be some
 *     network issues or the cluster is in an error state (possibly transient).
 *     In that case the class terminates the processing with either FAILED or
 *     PARTIAL status depending on wether it received at least one successful
 *     response.
 *
 * On early termination, any further responses from other nodes can be safely
 * ignored.
 *
 * Upon receiving an AGAIN error status from a storage node, this class attempts
 * to retry sending the request after some delay.
 *
 * This class is a shameless copypasta from FindKeyRequest.
