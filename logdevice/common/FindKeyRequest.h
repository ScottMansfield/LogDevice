/**

 *
 * == General concept ==
 *
 * Request that runs in the client library in order to satisfy an
 * application's call to the findTime() or findKey() API.  As described in the
 * APIs, the goal is to find a record at or after the key (in the case of
 * findTime(), the timestamp is the key) passed to the API.
 * See logdevice/include.Client.h.
 *
 * Because one storage node contains a subset of the log's records, we need to
 * talk to more than one node to find the correct answer.  This class
 * broadcasts a FINDKEY_Message to all storage nodes.  Each storage node
 * replies with a range (lo, hi] for which it can conclude that the overall
 * answer must be in, based on the contents of its local log store.  Edge
 * cases aside, `lo` will be the LSN of the latest record strictly before the
 * target key, while `hi` will be the LSN of the earliest record at or
 * after the target key.  By combining result ranges from all storage
 * nodes, taking max(lo) and min(hi), this class calculates the actual answer
 * as max(lo) + 1.
 *
 * If not all storage nodes send back a successful reply, we still may be able
 * to find the exact answer.  For example, if, after combining the ranges we
 * did get the result range is (8, 9], then we know that 9 is the answer.
 * If, however, the range is (8, 11], then any of 9, 10 or 11 may be the
 * correct answer.  The storage nodes containing information to resolve this
 * ambiguity failed to reply.  In this case, we return 9 to the application
 * (along with a status indicating partial success) so that, if the
 * application starts reading at that LSN, it will still read all records
 * since the desired timestamp, although possibly some earlier ones as well.
 *
 * For the findTime() API, there are two special cases (that conveniently don't
 * need special handling in the client).  If a timestamp is requested that is
 * earlier than all records in the log, all storage nodes return (0, x] with
 * different x, so the API returns LSN 1.  If a timestamp is requested that is
 * later than all records, all storage nodes return (last_record, LSN_MAX] with
 * different last_record, and the API returns max(last_record) + 1, which should
 * be the LSN that will be issued to the next written record.
 *
 * In order to satisfy our request, a storage node needs to know the last
 * released LSN for a log.  Normally this is kept in memory but if there has
 * not been any activity with the log since startup, the storage node needs
 * some time to find the last released LSN (in its local log store or by
 * asking the sequencer).  In that case it quickly responds with E::AGAIN and
 * the client retries after a short delay.  This is a design choice to make
 * implementation easier; the storage node could also block until the last
 * released LSN is found and only then respond to our message.
 *
 * == approximate result ==
 * If accuracy option is FindKeyAccuracy::APPROXIMATE, findTime() will
 * only perform binary search on the partition directory in order to find the
 * newest partition whose timestamp in the directory is <= given timestamp.
 * Then it will return first lsn of given log_id in this partition.
 * The result lsn can be several minutes earlier than biggest lsn which
 * timestamp is <= given timestamp. But execution of findtime() will be much
 * faster since instead of binary search over partitions in memory + binary
 * search inside partition on disk we only do first search.
 * NOTE: Result lsn may not exists in current local storage. Most likely record
 * with this lsn it will exists somewhere in cluster. But it can be
 * last released + 1, gap or bridge record.
