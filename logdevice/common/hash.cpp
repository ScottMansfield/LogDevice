  // Using ch() as a building block, this function returns a value from the set
  // {0, 1, ..., N-1} such that the probability of an arbitrary key
  // mapping to i-th bucket is weight_fn(i) / W (where W is the sum of all
  // weights). The algorithm, based on mcrouter/lib/WeightedCh3HashFunc.cpp,
  // does several iterations in which it computes h = ch({key, iter}, nbuckets),
  // repeating the process if hash64(key, iter) / 2^64 > weight_fn(h), and
  // returning h otherwise.
  // NOTE: since this algorithm may do multiple iterations depending on
  // weight_fn(h), the hash function is not completely consistent: some movement
  // between existing buckets is possible (the probability drops as weight_fn
  // approach 1.0).
  //
  // Considering that in each iteration weight_fn(h)
  // corresponds to the probability of stopping and returning h, and assuming
  // there's no limit on the number of iterations, probability P[i] of an
  // arbitrary key mapping to i-th bucket is:
  //
  //         P[i] = w[i]/N + P[i] * sum_{j=0}^{N-1}{1 - w[j]}/N
  //
  // (The first term corresponds to ch() returning i-th bucket with probability
  // 1/N and then selecting it, while the second equates to doing another
  // iteration of the loop.)  This results in P[i] = w[i]/W, as desired.
  // In practice, we do at most 128 iterations; the probability of not finding
  // a bucket after this many iterations is negligible, provided that the
  // average node weight is reasonably big (e.g. >= 0.15, in which case that
  // probability is smaller than 1e-9).
