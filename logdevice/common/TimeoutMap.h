/**
 * Libevent normally stores all timer events in a heap with a O(logN)
 * insertion time. We expect to insert and delete timers at a high
 * rate, with few of them expiring. Because of the way LogDevice API
 * is designed most of the timers will have the same timeout value --
 * the one passed to Client::create() or Client::setTimeout(). We
 * expect the number of distinct timeout values passed to various
 * timed requests (mainly, AppendRequest) over the life of a Processor
 * to be small. Libevent has an optimization for such a workload that
 * reduces the cost of insertion to O(1). It works by creating a
 * separate FIFO queue for all timers with the same commonly used
 * timeout value. These timeout values must be registered in advance
 * by calling event_base_init_common_timeout(). It returns a queue
 * identifier masquarading as a struct timeval. TimeoutMap objects contain
 * a map from std::chrono::millisecond values to such queue identifiers
 * for a specific event_base. The objective is to reduce the amount of CPU
 * used for timer management in LogDevice.
 *
 * see http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm/libevent-2.1/doxygen/html/event_8h.html
 * for details.
