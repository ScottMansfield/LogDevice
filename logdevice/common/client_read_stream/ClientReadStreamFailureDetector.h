/**
 * @file ClientReadStreamFailureDetector is a utility that detects slow storage
 * shards that should be put in the "greylist" when Single Copy Delivery is
 * active. Adding a shard to the greylist means instructing other shards to send
 * the data that it ought to send.
 *
 * When Single Copy Delivery is active, every record is to be sent by one and
 * only one shard in the storage set only. This means that the slowest shard in
 * the storage set will drive the slowness of the reader.
 *
 * This utility monitors how fast storage shards are sending and runs an outlier
 * detection algorithm to decide which shard should be put in the greylist at
 * any point in time.
 *
 * == How we measure how fast a shard is ==
 *
 * The metric used to measure how fast storage shards are sending consists in
 * measuring how quickly they complete each new window as the window is slid by
 * ClientReadStream.
 *
 * ClientReadStream calls two methods of this class: 1/ `onWindowSlid` to inform
 * that it slid the "window high" up to some LSN, 2/ `onShardNextLsnChanged` to
 * inform that a shard has sent a record/gap past some LSN.
 *
 * This utility keeps track of the timestamp of each time the window is slid
 * with the timestamp of each time a storage shard's next lsn moves past the
 * window. Because ClientReadStream does not wait until all storage shards have
 * completed the current window before sliding it (this is controlled by
 * --client-read-flow-control-threshold), we maintain a "rotating buffer" of two
 * "window slid" events materialized by cur_window_ and next_window_.
 *
 * == Outlier Detection Algorithm ==
 *
 * This utility keeps track of which shards have completed which window. Once
 * the number of shards remaining to complete the last window is below the
 * `maxOutliersAllowed()` threshold, we run an outlier detection algorithm
 * to determine if these shards should be greylisted to increase the speed
 * of window movement and hence record delivery.
 *
 * We leverage the utility in logdevice/commor/OutlierDetecton.h which can tell
 * us if these shards should be considered outliers or if we should wait more.
 * If we should wait more, we schedule a timer to try again after some time
 * suggested by the OutlierDetection utility. The detection may be tried again
 * before the timer triggers if another shard completes the window.
 *
 * == Adaptive sensitivity ==
 *
 * The OutlierDetection utility is given a `required_margin` parameter that
 * defines how sensitive the outlier detection is. For instance if the
 * value is 2, we will only declare outliers if they are 200% slower than the
 * average of the other shards.
 *
 * This parameter is adaptive. The more rewinds we perform due to changing
 * the list of outliers, the less sensitive the detection will become. The
 * more time spent successfully reading (higher rate of window slide events),
 * the more sensitive the detection becomes.
 *
 * The adaptive nature of the required margin helps protect ourselves against
 * degenerate cases where many shards alternate being slow.
 *
 * == Reinstating outliers ==
 *
 * When a shard is in the outlier list, we keep sending WINDOW messages to it
 * and the shard will try to send RECORDs/GAPs anyway. We cannot reinstate a
 * shard that is in the outlier list by simply waiting for it to complete the
 * window and measuring the latency. Indeed, because the shard is an outlier and
 * in the SCD known down list, ClientReadStream won't wait for it to chime in
 * before sliding the window.
 *
 * We instead use a strategy of proactively reinstating the shard after some
 * time. The time before an outlier is reinstated is also adaptive. It grows
 * exponentially as we keep detecting it as an outlier, and decreases linearly
 * when we are successfully reading (sliding the window) while the shard is not
 * in the list.
 *
 * == A cap on the allowed number of outliers ==
 *
 * A cap on the maximum amount of shards that can be considered outliers is
 * defined by the user through a call to changeWorkingSet.
 * ClientReadStreamScd uses it to ensure that there would never be R+ shards
 * (that are not AUTHORITATIVE_EMPTY) in the known down list, otherwise there
 * would not be any benefit of adding them as we would eventually encounter
 * a record fully replicated on these shards.
