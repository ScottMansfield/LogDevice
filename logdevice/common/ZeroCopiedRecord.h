/**
 * @file  ZeroCopiedRecord is an internal representation of Logdevice record
 *        originated from messages recevied from the network. In other words,
 *        the payload payload can be libevent evbuffer. The primary goal for
 *        ZeroCopiedRecord is to support efficient multi-cast in thread-safe
 *        manner, in specific:
 *         - shared pointer of ZeroCopiedRecord can be passed around among
 *           thread without worrying out evbuffer thread safety issues.
 *
 *         - payload can be written to evbuffers in multiple worker threads for
 *           multi-casting without copy using evbuffer_add_reference (or
 *           ProtocolWriter::writeWithoutCopy).
 *
 *         - once the refcount of ZeroCopiedRecord dropped to zero, it is
 *           guaranteed to be destroyed on the original worker thread that
 *           allocated the payload. This ensures the thread safety of evbuffer.
 *
 *        Important Note:
 *         - In practice, ZeroCopiedRecord (and its derived classes) must only
 *           be constructed using the factory method create() of each class.
 *           This ensures that ZeroCopiedRecord is ref counted using shared_ptr
 *           with a custom Deleter that disposes of the object in the correct
 *           thread.
 *
 *         - TODO T20422519: Currently it is required that the payload used to
 *           construct ZeroCopiedRecord must be linear, which means that for
 *           evbuffer payload one must call evbuffer_pullup
 *           (i.e., PayloadHolder::getPayload). evbuffer_pullup might be
 *           expensive and can cause extra copy, in the future we should enforce
 *           libevent to always allocate contiguous buffer when receiving
 *           payloads from network sockets.
