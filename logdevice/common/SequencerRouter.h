/**
 * @file  SequencerRouter is a utility class used to route a message to the
 *        sequencer for a log.  Since some nodes in the cluster may not be
 *        available, finding a sequencer is more involved than just hashing
 *        the log id; this is especially true for appends, which may in some
 *        cases even need to trigger sequencer reactivations.
 *
 *        SequencerRouter follows redirects and rehashes when a node is
 *        unavailable. Classes that use SequencerRouter implement its interface
 *        (SequencerRouter::Handler) and use start() to kick off the state
 *        machine, as well as onRedirect() and onNodeUnavailable() to influence
 *        the decision on which node to pick next.
 *
 *        Each SequencerRouter object should only be used from a single Worker
 *        thread.
