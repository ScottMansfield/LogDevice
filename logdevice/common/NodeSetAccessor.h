/**
 * @file  StorageSetAccessor is a utility class that handles the common pattern
 *        of requesting access (usually sending messages) to nodes in a nodeset
 *        of, a log and waiting for a subset of nodes that meet a specific
 *        property to reply before concluding the operation. There are two
 *        supported, failure-domain-aware, properties: F-MAJORITY and
 *        REPLICATION.
 *
 *        StorageSetAccessor accesses nodes in waves, for each wave, it attempts
 *        to access a subset of nodes. For F-MAJORITY property, it tries to
 *        access all nodes that are not yet reported success or permanent
 *        failure in each wave. For REPLICATION property, it attempts to send to
 *        a subset of nodes that may form a valid copyset together w/ the
 *        existing nodes that reported successful, plus a pre-defined amount of
 *        extra nodes.  StorageSetAccessor sends waves with a back-off retry
 *        timeout, and it keeps sending waves until receives enough replies from
 *        nodes to make a decision or the entire operation timed out.
