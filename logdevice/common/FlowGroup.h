/**
 * @file  A FlowGroup meters bandwidth for connections that share a common
 *        resource constraint. For example, connections to nodes within
 *        the same rack will contend on the bandwidth capacity of their
 *        top of rack switch, connections between racks will contend on
 *        on a cluster switch, and connections between regions will be
 *        limited by inter-site bandwidth.
 *
 *        FlowGroups behavior is controlled by a FlowGroupPolicy. This
 *        dictates the maximum burst and guaranteed bandwidth allocation
 *        for messages of each priority level. The policy also allows the
 *        definition of a bandwidth pool which will be shared amongst
 *        priority levels, but consumed in priority order as messages
 *        are dispatched at the end of each EventLoop run.
 *
 *        FlowGroups receive policy change notifications and their periodic
 *        bandwidth allotment via a FlowGroupsUpdate. FlowGroupsUpdates are
 *        distributed by the TrafficShaper
 *
 *        Initial configuration definitions and administrative updates of
 *        a FlowGroupPolicy are specified as global process limits. These
 *        are then normalized based on the number of workers and the
 *        bandwidth release frequency into per-worker and per-quantum
 *        values.
 *
 *        Traffic shaping is disabled by default. Like any other
 *        FlowGroupPolicy value, this can be changed dynamically and will
 *        take effect when the next FlowGroupsUpdate is released. See
 *        TrafficShaper for the default frequency of updates.
