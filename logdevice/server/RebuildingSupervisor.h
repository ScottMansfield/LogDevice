/**
 * @file RebuildingSupervisor is in charge of triggering rebuilding (writing
 * SHARDS_NEEDS_REBUILD events to the event log):
 *  - when a node is reported to be dead by the failure detector, and
 *  - when some of our own shards appear to be broken.
 * The RebuildingSupervisor subscribes to node state changes from the
 * ClusterState object. Upon receiving an update, it either adds a trigger to
 * execute after a grace period if the node is dead, or removes current trigger
 * if the node is now alive. When the grace period expires, the
 * RebuildingSupervisor determines which node (among the healthy nodes) is the
 * rebuilding leader. The rebuilding leader then triggers rebuilding for the
 * dead node if the conditions are right. The other non-leader nodes may
 * trigger rebuilding later as well if they realize the leader didn't.
 * The conditions to trigger rebuilding are the following:
 * - the node must be dead
 * - there must not be too many nodes dead at the same time (in which case we
 * throttle triggering rebuilding to not make things worse)
 * - the total number of nodes being rebuilt at this time must not be greater
 * than max_node_rebuilding_percentage, a configurable percentage of the
 * cluster size
 * - its shards status must be FULLY_AUTHORITATIVE
 * If these conditions are not met, the RebuildingSupervisor may reschedule the
 * trigger to wait for another grace period until the node is back alive, or
 * all of its shards have been rebuilt.
