   * Changes a setting.

   * @param name   setting name, as would be provided on the server command line
   *               (see Settings::addOptions() in logdevice/common/Settings.cpp)
   * @param value  string representation of value, as would be provided on the
   *               server command line
   *
   * Settings that are commonly used on the client:
   *
   * connect-timeout
   *    Connection timeout
   *
   * handshake-timeout
   *    Timeout for LogDevice protocol handshake sequence
   *
   * num-workers
   *    Number of worker threads on the client
   *
   * client-read-buffer-size
   *    Number of records to buffer while reading
   *
   * max-payload-size
   *    The maximum payload size that could be appended by the client
   *
   * ssl-boundary
   *    Enable SSL in cross-X traffic, where X is the setting. Example: if set
   *    to "rack", all cross-rack traffic will be sent over SSL. Can be one of
   *    "none", "node", "rack", "row", "cluster", "dc" or "region". If a value
   *    other than "none" or "node" is specified, --my-location has to be
   *    specified as well.
   *
   * my-location
   *    Specifies the location of the machine running the client. Used for
   *    determining whether to use SSL based on --ssl-boundary. Format:
   *    "{region}.{dc}.{cluster}.{row}.{rack}"
   *
   * client-initial-redelivery-delay
   *    Initial delay to use when downstream rejects a record or gap
   *
   * client-max-redelivery-delay
   *    Maximum delay to use when downstream rejects a record or gap
   *
   * on-demand-logs-config
   *    Set this to true if you want the client to get log configuration on
   *    demand from the server when log configuration is not included in the
   *    main config file.
   *
   * enable-logsconfig-manager
   *    Set this to true if you want to use the internal replicated storage for
   *    logs configuration, this will ignore loading the logs section from the
   *    config file.
   *
   * @returns On success, returns 0. On failure, returns -1 and sets
   *          logdevice::err to:
   *
   *            UNKNOWN_SETTING        name parameter was not recognized
   *            INVALID_SETTING_VALUE  value was invalid (e.g. not numeric for a
